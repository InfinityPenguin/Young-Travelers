		<p>The Young Travelers scholarships will be awarded to qualifying high school students in the U.S. The scholarship program is designed to sponsor high school students who lack access, resources, and support necessary for travel. Our goal is to expose disadvantage students to the world. 
</p>
		<p> We've partnered with study abroad programs and organizations that facilitate traveling abroad for high school students. For more information, message us below. </p>
